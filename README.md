This game was written back in 2019 year, when I just "jumped" into the web development.
The main purpose of writing it was to practice the basic concepts of JavaScript and its logic.
Therefore, there was not much focus on game design and responsive layout.

*I decided to upload this project just now because I want to share code and have all my projects at one place.*
